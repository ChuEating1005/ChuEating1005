# 👋 Hi, I'm I-Ting(Benjamin) Chu!

I'm a computer science student at NYCU 🇹🇼, passionate about AI/ML, 2D & 3D vision, image processing, networking, and web systems.
Currently working on cool stuff like 3D inpainting using diffusion models.

## 👥 Leadership

**President, NYCU Computer Science Student Association**  
Currently leading a 50-person team to organize diverse activities for the CS community — from company visits and alumni sharing sessions to tech workshops and entertainment events. I also serve as a bridge between students and faculty, advocating for student needs and fostering cross-grade connections.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🌐 Application & Websites

### 🤖 AI / ML

- **[Exposure Correction](https://github.com/ChuEating1005/Exposure-Correction)**  
  Enhanced image exposure using a deep learning pipeline based on the Zero-DCE framework. Introduced Laplacian pyramid decomposition and progressive refinement techniques for superior results. Built with PyTorch and CUDA.

- **[Homework Helper](https://github.com/ChuEating1005/Homework-Helper)**  
  A smart assistant Line Bot that answers homework questions from uploaded PDFs. Built with GPT-3.5 Turbo, LangChain, and Pinecone using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setup. Includes calendar/task syncing with Notion and Google Calendar.

### 🔧 Others

- **[Text-based Dungeon Game](https://github.com/ChuEating1005/DS-OOP)**  
  A C++ adventure game developed using object-oriented design principles. Features include player stats, dungeon map, turn-based combat, inventory management.

- **[SDN vRouter](https://github.com/ChuEating1005/SDN-NFV)**  
  Simulated a virtual router using Software-Defined Networking concepts. Implemented dynamic routing with custom packet forwarding logic and basic NFV features.

- **[Treasure Hunt](https://github.com/ChuEating1005/Treasure-Hunt)**  
  A 30-second 3D animation project built using OpenGL. Leveraged free Minecraft-style models and manually preprocessed body parts in Blender to enable character articulation. All movement and animation logic were programmed from scratch, resulting in a cinematic short rendered in real time. Result [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwIccvUqtNY).
